# JavaFX Calculator Application

## Overview
The JavaFX Calculator Application is a simple desktop calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The app features a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) built with JavaFX and SceneBuilder, making it easy to use for all users.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Clear and Reset**: Clear the current input or reset the calculator to its initial state.
- **On/Off Functionality**: Ability to turn the calculator on or off.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Designed using SceneBuilder for a clean and interactive interface.
- **Custom Icon**: The calculator window features a custom icon for visual appeal.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Used for application logic.
- **JavaFX**: Provides the GUI components.
- **SceneBuilder**: Used to visually design the FXML layout.
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: The IDE used for development.

## Setup and Running the Application

### Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** version 17 or higher.
- **JavaFX SDK** to be configured with your IDE.
- **IntelliJ IDEA** as the integrated development environment.

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository** from your version control system (e.g., GitHub).
2. **Open the Project in IntelliJ IDEA**:
   - Open IntelliJ and navigate to the project folder.
3. **Add JavaFX SDK** to the project using your IDEâ€™s project settings.
4. **Configure VM Options** to run JavaFX applications by setting the necessary module path to the JavaFX library.

### Running the Application
- **Run the Main Class**: In IntelliJ, locate the main application file (e.g., `HelloApplication.java`) and click the "Run" button.
- The calculator interface will be displayed, allowing you to start performing calculations.

## Usage
- **Performing Calculations**: Click the numeric buttons to input values and use the operation buttons (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to perform arithmetic.
- **Equals Button (`=`)**: Click to execute the calculation.
- **Clear Button (`C`)**: Clears the current number.
- **Reset Button (`CE`)**: Resets the entire calculator.
- **On/Off Button**: Turns the calculator on or off.

## Application Structure
- **Java Source Code**: Contains all Java classes for the application.
- **Resources Folder**: Contains FXML layout files and any images used by the application.
- **Images Folder**: Includes assets such as the calculator icon for the application window.

## Special Instructions
- Ensure the `images` folder is placed in the resources directory (`src/main/resources`) to correctly load icons.
- If the full calculator layout is not visible, resize the application window to fit the entire layout.

## Future Enhancements
- **Advanced Operations**: Add support for square root, percentage, and memory functions.
- **Improved Styling**: Use CSS to enhance the UI design.
- **Error Handling**: Improve validation to handle incorrect inputs gracefully.
